# Covid Data Visualization

A python implementation of learning and practcing data visualization with a custom Delaware covid dataset that I made during the COVID-19 pandemic.
This dataset has the data of Covid cases throughout Delaware, Maryland, Texas and California.
An machine learning algorithm, SVR is trained on the Delaware dataset

# What is SVR?
SVR, also known as support vector regression, is a machine learning algorithm used for regression analysis. SVR Model in Machine Learning aims to find a function that approximates the relationship between the input variables and a continuous target variable while minimizing the prediction error. Running my svr model on the Delaware Data and its infections gave an accuracy of 84%, which indicates the model fits the data very consistent.
